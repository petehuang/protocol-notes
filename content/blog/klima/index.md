Klima is a fork of Olympus that seeks to be a black hole for carbon credits, ultimately driving up the cost of carbon credits and applying pressure to carbon emitters.

Using the Olympus bond mechanism, Klima acquires carbon credits that are retired (brought out of circulation and cannot be used) and brought on-chain by [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/). In the end state, each Klima is backed by a carbon credit, so the value of each Klima is backed by the value of that carbon credit.
