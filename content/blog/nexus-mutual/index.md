Nexus Mutual sells insurance covering smart contract failure. This includes de-pegging of yield-bearing tokens or hacks on a specific protocol.

Nexus is driven by 3 parties: risk assessors, policyholders and claims assessors. Nexus is a legal entity in the UK, so to participate, you have to register and KYC. To do anything, you must purchase their native token NXM.

NXM is priced as a function of total funds under control by the mutual. The better the mutual performs, the better the token price.

Risk assessors evaluate a protocol and stake their NXM to express a vote of confidence in a protocol's security. They earn 50% of the premium on insurance sold after they stake. As more risk assessors express confidence in a protocol, the price of getting covered goes down. Risk assessors are also penalized if there ends up being a claim against the protocol. A proportion of their staked NXM gets burned if a claim ends up being approved.

The role of policyholders is self-explanatory: they buy insurance and file claims where applicable. 

Claims assessors stake NXM to vote on incoming claims. They receive rewards if they vote in-line with consensus. They can also get their NXM burned if they vote wrong - it's up to the governance process to determine when that's the case.
