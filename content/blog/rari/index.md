*Only covering Rari's Fuse product here since it's their flagship product.*

Fuse is basically [Aave](/aave/)- or [Compound](/compound/)-as-a-service. You can deploy your own lending market and configure every variable possible: which tokens are allowed, collateralization ratios, liquidation, etc. The only thing you apparently cannot set yourself is the borrowing fee - Rari collects a 10% fee.

The first aspect seems to be the biggest win. Aaves and Compounds of the world have to tightly control the tokens they allow since the entire system is exposed to the risk of all collateral that is deposited. By allowing a variety of markets to exist, each with their own configuration and audience, you could let some people deposit the more volatile tokens and limit the risk to just their market.
