Ondo dissects the LPT. In many LPT pairs, you have less risky token and a more risky token. For example, you might have DAI as the less risky token and ETH as the more risky token.

If we split up the pair and had two different people supply each side, you might imagine that the DAI supplier would be less risk-tolerant than the ETH supplier.

Ondo runs limited time period markets where they set a benchmark fixed yield rate for a stable-risky LP and invite people to supply either side of the LP. The assets are paired and yield accumulates. At the end of the term, the yield is first allocated to the fixed yield supplier until the benchmark rate is hit. All remaining yield goes to the risky asset supplier, who opted for a variable rate yield.

Impermanent loss is split between the two parties.

Fei and Ondo run a liquidity program, where Fei supplies the stable asset into an Ondo market, and the project supplies their target token as the risky asset. This doubles the liquidity (since Fei is matching) and kickstarts liquidity.
