Set allows you to create new tokens representing indices that track baskets of tokens. Some interesting sets that have been created: [metaverse](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/mvi), [FAANG stocks](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/faang), [DeFi 1.0](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi).

The Set itself is basically a bunch of metadata: name, symbol for the Set, distribution of tokens, beginning price of the index. When you buy a Set with ETH, the smart contract uses your ETH to exchange for each of the tokens in the right ratio. But instead of getting the underlying tokens, you get tokens representing the Set.

If you create a Set, you can charge a fee on your AUM.
