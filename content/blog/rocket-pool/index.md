Rocket Pool is a liquid staking protocol similar to Lido.

The main difference is that it is more open than Lido. While Lido requires an involved approval and onboarding process (leading to the small number of validator partners), Rocket Pool allows anyone to onboard as a node. There are over 1,000+ validators onboarded to Rocket Pool at time of writing.

Rocket Pool wraps your ETH as rETH.

70% of Rocket Pool's native token RPL is distributed to validators. While validators do not need to stake RPL to be a validator, those who do earn more of the RPL awards, especially those who stake more RPL as a percent of their ETH value.
