Wonderland is a direct fork of Olympus. I'm including a page here because of how often I've heard it mentioned among people who don't spend every day watching crypto stuff.

Wonderland has a lightly stated goal of becoming the currency of the metaverse. It's unclear what that looks like and how it will get there. Nevertheless, it is amassing a treasury of AVAX and MIM using the Olympus bonding mechanism. Its popularity is probably driven by its insane APY - north of 80,000% APY at time of writing - and expectation that it follows similar growth patterns as Olympus itself.

The major failure case of an Olympus fork is that people dump the yield, leading to a "I'm getting out before you can" market dynamic. It is the only clearly successful Olympus fork so far in that regard.
