Alchemix lets you take out loans and helps you pay back loans automatically. Instead of leaving your collateral idle (e.g., Compound), Alchemix puts your collateral into [yearn](/yearn/), collects the yield on yearn and uses it to pay off your debt for you.

Deposit DAI/ETH and get back alUSD/alETH. Alchemix will convert the DAI/ETH into yearn tokens and earn yield. As your debt gets paid off, you can mint more alUSD/alETH. At the end, you can close the loan with any of the tokens: DAI/ETH/alUSD/alETH.

alUSD and alETH stay pegged to their assets by way of the "Transmuter". As yield is earned, Alchemix collects reserves of DAI and ETH. If you put your alUSD and alETH back into Alchemix while it's collecting yield, it will slowly convert it back into DAI and ETH. 

In summary, you're basically getting an advance on the yield you earn from yearn.
