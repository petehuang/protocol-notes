We've established that [Convex holders are now valuable](/convex/) because of their significant holdings of CRV. You can imagine that some projects would want to directly *bribe* CVX voters to vote their way. If you vote our way, you get some of our token.

After you lock your CVX (obtaining vlCVX - vote-locked CVX), Convex enables you to delegate your gauge votes to another party. Votium is one such party to delegate to.

Votium distributes votes across all bribes according to the bribe's USD value. Votium then distributes the bribes proportional to the number of vlCVX delegated and the bribe size.
