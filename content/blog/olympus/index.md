Olympus is seeking to be a reserve currency backed by decentralized assets. Its impact is best understood in two parts: bonding and staking.

So far, we've seen lots of protocols using their native token to incentivize people to provide liquidity for that token and/or to use the product itself. This amounts to an expensive marketing tactic with a lot of churn. The attracted users' first instinct is to get the rewards, immediately dump them to cash out and pull the liquidity soon after.

Olympus bonds establish a trade where the user is given a discount on the native token in exchange for some asset, often an LPT of the native token but it could be any asset that Olympus is trying to acquire. This ultimately gives yield to the user while giving control of the liquidity to the protocol. Secondarily, because the protocol owns the liquidity, it will earn the LPT fees, and liquidity will be generally more stable.

Olympus uses this mechanism to acquire the assets for its treasury.

Let's talk about staking. In the end state, each of OHM will be worth 1 DAI or USD. When the reserve assets backing 1 OHM are worth more than $1, Olympus will continue to mint OHM by distributing a constant reward rate % to everyone staking OHM. Every 8 hours, OHM stakers receive more OHM.

Because token count is consistently expanding at a constant rate across the board, ownership of OHM is better expressed as "I own X% of OHM market cap/treasury" rather than "I own X OHM tokens". If OHM holders do not stake, they get diluted by the inflation.

OHM holders help set the parameters of the protocol, which affect which assets to intake to the treasury, how many bonds are available (and thus the intake rate of new assets into the treasury), the inflation rate of new OHM tokens, etc.

Olympus itself has spun out its bonding mechanism into a program called Olympus Pro, where Olympus earns fees from other protocols who use the Olympus bonding infrastructure for their liquidity.
