Abracadabra manages the Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin. Similar to Maker, you deposit collateral and the protocol issues you stablecoin. The key differences:

Abracadabra focuses on **interest-bearing tokens** as collateral. This could be yearn tokens, LPTs that have incentives, staked dex tokens that accrue interest from trading fees, etc. These tokens mostly have a track record of going up in price (as interest accrues). Tokens that remain stable in price *and* accrue interest (e.g., yearn-wrapped stablecoins) enable loose collateral ratios - users can borrow more using their collateral than would be allowed other tokens on other platforms.

63% of SPELL, Abracadabra's governance token, is emitted across various incentive programs to encourage MIM usage and liquidity. Much of this is distributed through dex farms and the Curve Wars. The team has a track record of revisiting SPELL emissions, often proposing to burn SPELL tokens to reduce unneeded dilution.

Abracadabra allows you to leverage your position. You deposit your interest-bearing token, Abracadabra converts it to MIM, other stablecoins, then finally back to the original interest-bearing token.

You can stake SPELL to receive sSPELL. Abracadabra takes the borrow, interest and liquidation fees and puts them into a pool of SPELL. As more fees accrue like this, your sSPELL is worth more than SPELL, and you can exchange back to capture the interest. Additionally, 10% of all liquidation fees are used to buy back SPELL on the open market. The SPELL purchased also goes into the same pool.
