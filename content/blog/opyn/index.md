Opyn is an options protocol, allowing anyone to write and trade options.

To write an option, the writer simply needs to mint an oToken that represents the option. If they need to put up collateral, they can open a vault and deposit the collateral.

Opyn's Controller contract is the primary execution point for all options: managing vaults, executing option redemptions, managing mints and burns of oTokens, etc.
