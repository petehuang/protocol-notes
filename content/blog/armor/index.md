Armor offers insurance for DeFi assets, underwritten by [Nexus Mutual](/nexus-mutual/).

Armor runs several earning pathways. First, you can deposit NXM and get arNXM. Armor will pool the NXM and stake it into Nexus' risk assessment operations, which gets a cut of the premium. This is passed to arNXM. 10% of the fees will go to the Armor treasury, which helps cover situations when claims result in lost NXM.

arNFT is an Armor interface for buying coverage. You can either buy coverage here (the output is an NFT), which doesn't require KYC like buying from Nexus. You can also stake this coverage to arCore, which is Armor's main product. arCore allows users to buy coverage on a pure pay-as-you-go basis across various protocols with pooled billing - you deposit some credit at the start and it ticks down as your coverage is active. If you stake arNFT, you get 90% of the profit here. The other 10% goes to treasury.

Finally, arShield will wrap interest-bearing tokens (e.g., yearn tokens) with insurance (arTokens). The yield from the tokens will directly pay for the insurance. arShield fees go to treasury.
